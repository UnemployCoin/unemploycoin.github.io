      <h2>Project Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We're building a decentralized resume database — resumes stored on-chain, searchable by employers, powered by $UNEMP.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Why?</strong> Because finding a job shouldn't mean giving away your data to corporations who ghost you anyway.
