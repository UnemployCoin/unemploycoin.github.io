# UnemployCoin Whitepaper

## Abstract
UnemployCoin is a decentralized meme token on Polygon built to support unemployed and economically excluded individuals. It combines community, transparency, and crypto tools to create a purpose-driven movement.

## Problem
Traditional systems provide limited, inconsistent support to unemployed individuals, and existing crypto projects often lack real-world impact or fairness.

## Solution
UnemployCoin offers a transparent, fully distributed token with no insider advantage. Built on Polygon for speed and low fees, it aims to become a decentralized support mechanism backed by its community.

## Tokenomics
- Total supply: 1,000,000,000 UNEMP
- No presale, no dev tax
- Verified Polygon ERC-20 contract
- [View Contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xe1e64a89c7b95f23c601943147228784cca35395)

## Roadmap
[See full roadmap](./roadmap.md)

## Vision
A crypto-powered support system where economic struggle becomes a shared mission â€” not a shameful statistic.
